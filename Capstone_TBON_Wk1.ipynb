Everyone has their unique taste of what they like, and their lifestyle could be different from others. Due to this, you need to do your own research to identify a neighborhood that you would love to live in. The purpose of this Project is to help users in exploring better facilities around their residence. It will help them make a well-informed decision supported by data. For purpose of demonstration, we are using the Scarborough county in Toronto as an example but this model can be used for any county, suburb or district in any city around the world as long as there are data points available to run this model.\nLots of people are migrating to various states of Canada and needed lots of research for good housing prices and reputed schools for their children. This project is for those people who are looking for better neighborhoods. For ease of accessing to Cafe, School, Super market, medical shops, grocery shops, mall, theatre, hospital, likeminded people, etc.\nThis Project aim to create an analysis of salient features for the user to search a best neighborhood as a comparative analysis between neighborhoods.
